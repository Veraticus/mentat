# Queue System Integration - Phase 21

## Overview
Phase 21 successfully wired together all queue components to create a complete, integrated queue system with end-to-end message flow.

## Components Integrated

### 1. QueueSystem
The main integration point that combines:
- **Coordinator**: Implements the MessageQueue interface
- **Manager**: Handles fair scheduling and conversation isolation
- **WorkerPool**: Dynamic pool of workers for message processing
- **RateLimiter**: Token bucket rate limiting per conversation

### 2. Key Integration Points

#### Message Flow
1. Messages enter via `QueueSystem.Enqueue()`
2. Coordinator creates internal Message and QueuedMessage objects
3. Manager handles fair scheduling across conversations
4. Workers pull messages and process them
5. Stats are computed from actual message states

#### State Management
- Worker sets message state directly (no double state machine transitions)
- Coordinator computes statistics from actual message states
- Manager handles conversation queue lifecycle

#### Rate Limiting
- Properly configured with burst limit as capacity
- Rate limit errors trigger retry with backoff
- Messages are re-submitted after rate limiting

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **State Transition**: Removed duplicate state transitions between Manager and Worker
2. **Statistics**: Coordinator.Stats() now queries actual message states instead of relying on counters
3. **Rate Limiter Configuration**: Fixed parameter order (burst as capacity, not rate)
4. **Worker Pool Shutdown**: Fixed race condition by sending stop command before canceling context
5. **Rate Limit Handling**: Added proper retry logic for locally rate-limited messages

## Testing
Comprehensive integration tests verify:
- Simple message flow
- Conversation ordering
- Rate limiting behavior
- Worker scaling
- Error handling and retry

All tests pass consistently across multiple runs.
